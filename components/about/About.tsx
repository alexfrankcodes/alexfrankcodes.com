              Hi there! My name is Alex. I{"'"}m currently working as a Software
              Engineer for Southwest Airlines! âœˆ I work remotely from San Jose,

              When I{"'"}m not hacking away at code, you can find me exploring
              new hiking trails, spending time with my friends and family,
              reading, or playing video games.
